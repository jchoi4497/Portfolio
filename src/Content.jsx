          {`This project holds personal significance because it was inspired by my own gym journey and the challenges I faced staying organized and knowing what exercises to do. Like many people who are new to the gym, I often felt unsure about which workouts to choose or how to structure my sessions. To solve this, I built an interactive single page application using React for dynamic state management and a component based design. Tailwind CSS was used to create a clean, responsive, and scalable user interface, while Firebase Firestore handled data storage, allowing users to log, edit, and delete customized workout sessions.
            To take the experience further, I integrated the OpenAI API, enabling the app to analyze workout logs and provide personalized insights and suggestions based on user input. I also implemented Recharts to visualize workout data, allowing users to track their progress and spot trends over time.
            The app features categorized exercise ordering and intuitive input handling to guide users through their routines. By combining full CRUD functionality with AI powered feedback, visual data tracking, and user focused design, this application helps both beginners and experienced lifters stay consistent, informed, and confident in the gym.

            Implemented a location search component with real time query handling, displaying results with actionable buttons to update the mapâ€™s focus.
            Utilized TypeScript to enforce strict typing across components, improving code reliability and maintainability.
            Integrated React Leaflet to render map markers and smooth fly to animations upon location selection.
            Styled the UI with Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive, and accessible user experience.
            Added a light/dark mode toggle using Tailwind CSS dark classes, ensuring fast load times, semantic markup, accessibility, responsiveness, and seamless theme switching without impacting performance or crawlability.
            Structured the app using modular components and TypeScript interfaces to streamline data flow and ensure type safe API response handling.
